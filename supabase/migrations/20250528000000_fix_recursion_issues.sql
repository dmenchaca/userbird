  # Fix infinite recursion in RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - Infinite recursion detected in multiple RLS policies
    - All attempts to fix with complex policies have failed
  
  2. Solution
    - Disable RLS completely on all tables
    - Recreate with minimal public policies
    - Verify system works before adding back complex policies
