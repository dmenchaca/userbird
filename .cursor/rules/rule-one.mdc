- When removing a property or function, first search for all references to that property/function in the codebase before making changes

- When making changes that affect types or interfaces, make sure to update all dependent files to maintain type compatibility.

- For any changes to shared constants or interfaces, check all imports and usages to ensure backward compatibility or update all dependent files accordingly.

- Please create a draft implementation first and review for potential errors like unused variables, timing issues, and edge cases before finalizing the code. Pay special attention to variable declarations, ensuring each one serves a clear purpose in the implementation.
